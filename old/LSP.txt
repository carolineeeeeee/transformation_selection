To evaluate, we take a random subset of CV-HAZOP and transformations, study missed ones and correctly matched ones.
(what is the correct? This can be defined: A given lexico-syntactic pattern is considered to have matched correctly, if its results
(hypernym/hyponym(s)) can be rephrased into a structure as the one presented in example (2). (2) NP1, NP2..., (and | or) NPn is a NP0 for all NPi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, hyponym(NPi, NP0)
How do we define the previous criteria? What is changed how something like this?
criteria for good accuracy: 80% from https://aclanthology.org/R11-2017.pdf)
After this LSP matching, the N's and V's should be pointing to a transformations. 
same thing can be done with the transformations. (finding keywords for them like this)
Then remove words that don't matter to image processing (dictionary mathcing)
then we consider synonyms 

# how to deal with requirements for combinations of transformations?
# something simple to replace human threshold?

# How do we connect it to the collaboration? This can be connected to CARLA scenario generation. 
Shall we call it test generation in this case?
# or should we dig the dataset evaluation angle? if there is no original images, what do we do? there is NR-IQA
using one model may not make sense because of model limitation: how to know if it's because the model is not powerful enough rather than dataset is not good?

# if we do ASE, we can completely ignore requirements and do test generation/dataset eval. The coverage would be coverage of parameter domains (with respect to a distribution, probability wise), IQA range


the nltk pos tagger is unable to correctly tag sentences like 'increase shasow complexity', have to preprocess to 'This increases shadow complexity.'
