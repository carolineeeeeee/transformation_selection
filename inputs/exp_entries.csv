Risk Id,Location,Guide Word,Parameter,Meaning,Consequence,Risk
3,Light Sources,"Less (less of, lower)",Number,Few light sources (fewer light sources than expected),Too faint light (in parts of the scene),Sensor will receive too faint light from some scene regions
86,Light Sources,Reverse,Spectrum,The light source emits no light in the expected spectrum,Insufficient light in scene,Underexposure
124,Light Sources,No (not none),Intensity,L.s. is off,,Captured camera noise leads to fake effects
141,Light Sources,"Less (less of, lower)",Beam properties,Focused beam,Only fractions of objects will be lit,Large parts of scene may be dark
199,Medium,"Less (less of, lower)",Spectrum,Medium acts as a filter and changes the light's spectrum,Skewed colours,Failed detection - since training data was obtained under unfiltered light
200,Medium,As well as,Spectrum,Medium has similar colour as nearby l.s./object,Low contrast,Objects and medium become indistinguishable
204,Medium,"More (more of, higher)",Texture, Medium is more texturized than expected,"Object appearance can be significantly distorted, e.g. fragmented",Object recognition hampered
211,Medium,Other than,Texture,Texture of medium is different than expected,Influences of medium on scene appearance is unexpected,Algorithms trained for a certain medium are confused
296,Object,Close,Position,Object Closer to Observer than expected,,
371,Object,"More (more of, higher)",Complexity,Object is more complex than expected,,"Parts of object not recognized or misinterpreted, "
421,Object,No (not none),Spectrum,Object has no specific colour,"Object's colour fully depends on incoming light, i.e. it reflects all light as received",Object is not recognized at all (e.g. a white wall or a mirror)
478,Object,"More (more of, higher)",Reflectance,Obj. has much Refl. (more than expected),Shiny surface - mirror,Object not recognized
537,Objects,No (not none),Number,Number of objects is not detectable/decidable,"Scene with ""unknown"" number of objects",False negatives: CV alg. misses detection of some objects
611,Objects,"Less (less of, lower)",Occlusion,Less objects occlude each other than expected,More details of objects are visible,Detection quality is decreased by too much clutter in the scene
651,Objects,"More (more of, higher)",Shadowing,More shadowing than expected,Large parts of scene in shadow,Underexposure: objects in shadow not detected
827,Observer - Optomechanics,Other than,Field of View,Orientation/Position is Other than expected,Tilt view,Objects not recognized
869,Observer - Optomechanics,Temporal aperiodic,Viewing orientation,VOrient changes in a temporally aperiodic manner,Motion blur,Occasional misinterpretation of scene
910,Observer - Optomechanics,"More (more of, higher)",Transparency,The sensor optics is more transparent than expected,Overall scene intensity as received by the electronics is higher than expected,"Overexposure, at least of specific objects"
1017,Observer - Optomechanics,"Less (less of, lower)",Focusing,DoF is smaller than expected,Blurry image,Detection of edges and their correct position deteriorated
1120,Observer - Electronics,"More (more of, higher)",Exposure and shutter,Longer exposure time than expected,More light captured per image than expected,Overexposure
1159,Observer - Electronics,"Less (less of, lower)",Resolution (spatial),Pixel size is larger than expected,Pixel size is larger than expected,Lower noise level than expected
